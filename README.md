## Standardized Testing Competitive Analaysis ACT vs SAT

### Objective

The College Board has employed a fictious consulting firm, 'Hoppes LLC', to do a competitive analysis on it's main competitor: the ACT. When they had us in for our last competitive analysis in 2014-2015, the College Board was concerned with the ACT having surpassed the number of students that take the SAT every year. Because of this the College Board wanted to focus on trying a few different strategies to improve volume of test takers including: marketing the SAT as a compliment to and not a replacement of the ACT, winning state compulsory testing contracts and they were even considering giving away the test for free. Our main goal is to test the hypothesis that the trend of the ACT's strong performance has continued, but we will test to see whether some of these initiatives have worked.

## Classification of Emails Using Unstructured Text from Reddit

### Objective

After finishing up successful campaigns at the College Board and Zillow, word of Hoppes LLC’s data science prowess has been traveling far and wide. So far and wide that one day you get a call from Canada’s largest and longest multi-faith event, the World Religions Conference. Johnny Doe’s job was to work with IT to set up religion specific email addresses and update the marketing materials with those email addresses so the thousands of conference attendees could follow with presenters and organizers. This is especially important as this is the year’s flagship event that generates a disproportionate amount of connections, and it is imperative that the religion divisions be able to respond quickly. Johnny was feeling the pressure, and he was in such a rush that he forgot to update the materials for the Buddhism and Christianity, religions that total a combined 2.7 billion devotees world wide. These events usually generate 1,000s of emails and now they will be jumbled and unorganized in a general inbox. The Christianity and Buddhism divisions are freaking out, and needless to say Johnny was relegated back to coffee duty for the remainder of his summer.

## Estimating the Loss in Labor due to Hurricane Harvey

### Objective


Every year there are a number of natural disasters that effect a local population in the United States. The ability to predict potential wage loss from certain natural disasters around the US would provide real time support for future natural disasters. Allowing government response and intervention to ensure that the local economy can recover with minimal impact to the displaced.

In order to take the initial step for a proof of concept. A method was created to collect employment information and sector-specific wage estimations (such as Glassdoor and Indeed) to predict the potential wage loss due to a natural disaster. Based on the dataset, the tool will provide an estimation about the projected economic loss in a given locality based on the reported or estimated wage loss in the locality.
